## Project Overview 
Engaging in a comprehensive analysis of loan repayment data to discern key factors influencing borrower defaults. The project leverages Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to forge predictive models that inform and optimize lending decisions, thus reducing financial risks in real-time banking scenarios.

## Problem Statement

Addressing the crucial challenge in the banking sector of minimizing financial risks while balancing loan approvals with effective management of defaults. The objective is to enhance understanding of demographic and financial predictors of loan repayment behaviours, thereby enabling more personalized and effective lending strategies.


### Current Focus
- Performing in-depth EDA to identify and visualize relationships between borrower characteristics and their default probabilities.
- Applying  more techniques like regression analysis to predict default likelihood, aiding in the development of robust risk assessment tools for the banking industry.

### Achievements to Date
- Executed comprehensive data cleaning including handling missing values, correcting data signs, and renaming variables for better clarity and analysis efficiency.
- Identified key demographic and financial variables that impact loan defaults, aiding in the modification of the bankâ€™s credit evaluation process.

### Status
Ongoing; continuously refining models and updating analytical methods to enhance results.
